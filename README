This is a script to build an OS X version of zynaddsubfx
(http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net)

All build-dependencies are compiled from scratch and an
application bundle is created after compilation.

It requires a working c-compiler with C++11 support (Xcode tools)
bash, sed, curl make and git (all available by default on OSX).

The script can be run by a 'normal user' (no sudo required).

For more information, please see the comments in osx-build-zyn.sh

Usage: 
  git clone git://github.com/zynaddsubfx/zyn-build-osx.git
  cd zynbuild
  ./osx-build-zyn.sh
